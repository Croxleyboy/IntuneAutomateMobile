## 🎯 **Purpose**

IntuneAutomate makes gaining quick insights into your Microsoft Intune tenant simple and secure. While Intune is powerful, sometimes you need fast, actionable data without extra complexity.
This solution is Microsoft-focused and runs entirely within your own tenant, leveraging your existing security posture—no external subscriptions required.
A ready-to-use automation toolkit built using:
 
- **x1 SharePoint List**  
- **x6 Microsoft Power Automate Flows**  
- **x1 Microsoft Power Application**  
- **Microsoft Intune/Entra data**    

Our goal is to **simplify access to Intune data** and gain quick insights as a Manager or IT Admin - Improve quick access to compliance, Licensing, Applications registered, policies deployed and device status — all while leveraging tools you already have in Microsoft 365.
