## 🎯 **Purpose**

IntuneAutomate makes gaining quick insights into your Microsoft Intune tenant simple and secure. While Intune is powerful, sometimes you need fast, actionable data without extra complexity.
This solution is Microsoft-focused and runs entirely within your own tenant, leveraging your existing security posture—no external subscriptions required.
A ready-to-use automation toolkit built using:
 
- **x1 SharePoint List**  
- **Microsoft Power Automate**  
- **Microsoft Power Application**  
- **Microsoft Intune**    

Our goal is to **simplify access to Intune data** be that as a manager or It Admin and improve quick access to compliance, Licensing, Applications registered, policies deployed and device status — all while leveraging tools you already have in Microsoft 365.
